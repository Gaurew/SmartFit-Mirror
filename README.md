This project explores the functionalities of hand detection, tracking, and further extends to pose detection using OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries in Python.

<h1 style:"font-size:200px">Overview </h1>
We initiated this project by focusing on hand detection and tracking to establish a foundational understanding. Our subsequent steps involve expanding into pose detection, a crucial aspect that provides landmarks on the human body.

The goal is to leverage the detected landmarks' placement on the body to precisely position and adapt garments or apparel according to specific requirements.

<h1 style:"font-size:200px">Project Structure </h1>
main.py: Contains the Python script for real-time hand detection, landmark tracking, and frame processing.

Python 3.8.10<br>
OpenCV-python<br>
Mediapipe<br>

<h1 style:"font-size:200px">Instructions </h1>

Upon running the script, your camera feed will display in real-time with hand landmarks highlighted.
The console will output the coordinates of detected hand landmarks, specifically targeting tip points.

<h1 style:"font-size:200px">Future Enhancements </h1>
Integration of pose detection for comprehensive body landmark tracking.<br>
Development of garment/apparel placement algorithms based on detected body landmarks.
